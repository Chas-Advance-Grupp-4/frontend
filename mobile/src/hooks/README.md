src/hooks/

Custom React Hooks that encapsulate stateful logic.
Examples:

useAuth.ts (login, logout, current user)

useShipments.ts (fetch + cache shipments)

useScanner.ts (handle QR scan results and validation)

useNetworkStatus.ts (detect offline/online mode)

ðŸ‘‰ Think: reusable logic shared across screens/components.
