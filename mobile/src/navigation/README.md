src/navigation/

Navigation setup and wrappers â€” equivalent to routes/ in the PWA.
Examples:

AppNavigator.tsx (root stack navigator)

AuthNavigator.tsx (login/register flow)

MainNavigator.tsx (dashboard, scan, shipments)

types.ts (TypeScript types for route params)

ðŸ‘‰ Think: all navigation logic lives here, not in the screens.
