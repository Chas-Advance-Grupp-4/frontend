hooks/

Custom React Hooks that encapsulate reusable state/data logic.
Examples:

useAuth.ts (login, logout, current user)

useShipments.ts (fetch + cache shipments)

useWebSocket.ts (real-time data)

useForm.ts (form state & validation)

ðŸ‘‰ Think: Smart hooks that wrap logic you need across multiple pages/components.
